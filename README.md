# Codly: Create Open Roberta Programs with AI

Welcome to Codly, a project that provides AI-assisted support for creating Open Roberta programs. Codly is a collaborative project where we learn together and share our knowledge of Open Roberta.

**Goal:**

* The goal of Codly is to make it easier for students to get started with programming and robotics using Open Roberta.
* With the help of AI, we can automatically generate and explain Open Roberta programs to simplify the learning process.

**Content:**

In this repository, you will find various Open Roberta programs that were created with the help of AI. The programs demonstrate various programming concepts, such as:

* **Fundamentals:** Simple movements, sensors, loops, and conditions
* **Advanced Features:** Variables, logical operations, mathematical operations
* **Line Following:**  Programs that make a robot follow a line
* **P-Controller:** Programs that use a P-controller to improve the accuracy of line following

**How can I use the repository?**

* **Open Roberta Lab:** You can import the XML programs into Open Roberta Lab and run them on your robot.
* **Learning:**  You can use the programs as inspiration for your own projects. 
* **Contributing:** You are welcome to add your own Open Roberta programs to the repository.  

**How can I contribute to the project?**

* **Create Programs:** You can create your own Open Roberta programs and share them in the repository. 
* **Improve Documentation:** You can supplement the README file and the Wiki with additional information.
* **Report Bugs:**  If you find any bugs in the programs, please let us know.
* **Provide Feedback:** Your feedback and ideas are important so that we can continue to improve Codly.

**Next Steps:**

* We are working to improve Codly and add new features. 
* In the future, we want to develop an AI that can automatically generate Open Roberta programs.

**Collaboration:**

We look forward to your collaboration! Let's explore the world of robotics with Open Roberta together! ðŸ˜Š
